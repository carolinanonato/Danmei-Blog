title: Tian Guan Ci Fu

The ultimate love story. A fantasy novel about a fallen god and his most devoted worshipper (who is a ghost king) during 800 years. Written by the only and one Mo Xiang Tong Xiu. 

Honestly Tiān Guān Cì Fú] (TGCF) is probably the best thing that happened to me in 2020 and I was in an actual crisis then I finished its 2050 pages. The story follows many characters, but the lead is Zie Lian, the Crown Prince of Xian Le kingdom. After ascending to the Heavens for the third time he now has a task to investigate some mysterious deaths of young brides.  

“_To me, the you in your greatest glory is you, the you that has fallen from grace is also you, the most important thing is you, not what kind of you._”
