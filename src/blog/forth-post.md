title: The Scum Villain's Self-Saving System
---

Never before have I loved something so trashy so much.  The Scum Villain's Self-Saving System or SVSS, for short, it’s the funniest danmei written my MXTX. 

Shen Yuan is finishing reading a book named Proud Immortal Demon Way and criticizing the choices that leads the protagonist to death. He suddenly suffers an accident and ends up reborning into the book in the body  of Shen Qingqiu—the beautiful but cruel teacher to a young Luo Binghe, a half demon and male lead.  Luo Binghe was abused to the point of no return. And when he found out that he was half demon, he embraced it and went into rampage, killing innocent life and at the same time creating a harem. So now Shen Yuan (or Shen Qingqiu) was given a mission to not let that happen.
