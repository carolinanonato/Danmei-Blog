<div><p>Mo Dao Zu Shi (MDZS) is a novel written by Mo Xiang Tong Xiu.</p>
<p>Here we have our main character, Wei Wuxian, a troublemaker that despite being shameless, mischievous and reckless, has good intentions. Because of some bad things that happened to him and because he’s really good, he single-handedly started demonic cultivation - and raised people from death to fight against tyranny. People misunderstood him and while out of control, he was betrayed and “killed”.</p>
<p>A decade later, he is summoned into the body of a lunatic and has to fulfill the original body wishes, alongside some very troublesome things that are happening. To help him with his adventures he has Lan Wangli, an old friend from the past who promised to stay by his side. If you like adventure, slow-burn romance, paranormal, zombies (I guess) and ancient fantasy, this book is definitely for you.</p>
<p>Also, there is Netflix TV series based on this novel called The Untamed, and it rocked big time. The algorithm  probably recommended to you.</p>
<p><em>“Suddenly, he felt that the world had no place for him, despite how large it was.”</em></p>
