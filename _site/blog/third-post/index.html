<div><p>2HA, or Erha, or &quot;The Husky and His White Cat Shizun&quot; is the most emotional book that I’ve ever read. It’s been years and I’m still thinking about it, at least one or two times a week. It's written by the one and only Meatbun (that's their pen name)</p>
<p>The main lead is Mo Ran, the young disciple of the most powerful cultivator in the world, Chu Wanning. Because of several misunderstandings they pass years hating each other. Unbeknownst to Chu Wan Ning, in a past life, Mo Ran and Chu Wan Ning ended in great bloodshed and misery when Mo Ran turned to the dark cultivating techniques. The now 16-year old Mo Ran suddenly wakes up with that knowledge regarding the past and believing he can change his tragic end, he soon finds out things are not as they seemed to be.</p>
<p>This novel comes with serious trigger warnings/problematic content, which you can find listed in the english fan translation, so read carefully before dive in!</p>
